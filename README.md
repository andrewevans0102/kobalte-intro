# Kobalte Intro

This is a companion project to my upcoming LogRocket post "Build a SolidJS UI with Kobalte."

The project is built with SolidJS and uses Kobalte for components. To learn more about Kobalte, check out their documentation at [https://kobalte.dev/docs/core/overview/introduction](https://kobalte.dev/docs/core/overview/introduction).

Some of the examples were copied from the LogRocket post [Intro to Solidjs](https://blog.logrocket.com/introduction-solidjs/). Other example components from Kobalte [were taken from their documentation page](https://kobalte.dev/docs/core/overview/introduction).

The project can be ran locally with the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

The project has three pages that showcase how you can use Kobalte:

1. `WithoutKobalte.tsx` showcases a basic web page without using Kobalte
2. `WithKobalte.tsx` showcases the same web page as `WithoutKobalte.tsx` but with Kobalte components
3. `AdvancedKobalte.tsx` showcases advanced usages of the Kobalte components
